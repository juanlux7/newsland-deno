This project was made with the main purpose of testing the new JavaScript technology: Deno by using some of the most common real world functionalities such as:

- Authorization with custom middlewares
- Authentication with JSON web tokens (JWT)
- Password encryption with bcryptjs
- Static files availability
- Cloud Database system with MongoDB and mongo atlas
- API REST architecture
- Modification of certain third-party modules, by downloading and requesting them locally, in order to fix some version inconsistensies
- Web optimization techniques like minifying static files, defer blocking Javascript files etc (performance tested with Google analytics)
- Front-end work by writing all the HTML & CSS from scratch with modern implementation of CSS grid, flexbox etc

## Brief description of the project

This is a live website consisting on international news served by categories, with premium resources, authentication system, sections like most read articles, latest posts etc. This is version 1.0 of a future website that I am planning to make it bigger by adding more things like comment section, administration panel etc.
